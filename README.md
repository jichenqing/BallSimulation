# BallSimulation

Build a bouncy ball animation using tkinter individually, based on the principles of inheritance. The purpose of this project is to override the inherited objects and use tkinter to demonstrate it. Create the class “Simulton” that has locations and dimensions, then the class “Mobile_Simulton” that derives from “Simulton” but has angles and speeds, the “Prey” inherits from “Mobile_Simulton” that distincts the Prey instances from “Black_Hole” instances. “Ball” inherits from “Prey” and is displayed as a moving, bouncing ball on canvas. The “Floater” is a “Ball” that randomly changes its speed and angle. The “Black_Hole” is a “Simulton” that is displayed as a black dot on canvas and determines whether a “Ball”/”Floater” is moving into its dimension. A “Pulsator” is a “Black_Hole” that grows/ shrinks depending on whether or not it eats Ball within 30 seconds. “Hunter” is derived from the Mobile_Simulton and Pulsator classes, which is a mobile Pulsator that catches up the nearest “Prey”. Each “Simulton” can be initialized by clicking the corresponding buttons on canvas and clicking anywhere below the buttons on canvas to place the Simulton. Clicking the start button to start the animation and the time, which is displayed on canvas as well.
